Respected Sir/Madam,
                                With great pleasure, we would like to apprise you that the consortium of students and the faculty members of the Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM), Kolkata are collaborating with the Maker Faire. We would like to take this opportunity to invite you to participate in this fair.
                                The Maker Faire catalyzes innovation and entrepreneurship in India at the grassroots level. This fair gives a big opportunity to innovators, who are quietly working day and night giving their very best to come up with mind-blowing pieces of innovation which reshapes the very fabric of technology, to come out in the open and put forward their marvellous piece of art in front of the whole world getting the chance to share their projects, find collaborators and potential sponsors leading to further development. We hope to make it an arena to exhibit the creativity and the talent of students in the varied dimension of art, science and technology. It is our endeavour to challenge participants to think, innovate and most importantly push themselves to go that extra mile. The following links give a much better idea of the Maker Faire:

We will be looking forward to your participation.
